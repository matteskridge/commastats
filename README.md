3. In the ACP, enable the extension

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Commas do not appear on the board**

1. Ensure you have JavaScript enabled.
2. Clear the board cache via ACP -> General -> Purge the Cache -> Run now
3. Ensure the extension is enabled via Customize -> CommaStats -> Enable
4. Ensure that you are using a prosilver-derived theme, and that your theme hasn't been modified enough from prosilver to prevent the plugin from working.
